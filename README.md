## Description

This Project is built with normal **[MUI Date Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-picker)** without using of [MUI Date Range Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-picker) which is **pro version** and need license to use.

Working principle for selecting dates are nearly similar with [MUI Date Range Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-picker). But there are some differences. 

e.g. [MUI Date Range Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-picker) works with 2 input boxes and this project is only work with single input box.

There are some design flaws but it's really OK to be used for normal application.
